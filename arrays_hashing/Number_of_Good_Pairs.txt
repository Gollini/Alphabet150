# Intuition
The problem requires us to find pairs of indices (i,j) such that the elements at these indices are equal.
My first thought was to iterate through the list and compare every element with the others that come after it.

# Approach
* Initialize counter to zero.
* Use a nested loop structure to iterate through all possible pairs of indices.
* For each pair of indices (i,j), check if the elements at these indices are equal.
* Increment the count if the elements are equal
* Return the value of count as the total number of identical pairs.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
Since I am using two nested loops to compare each element with every other element that comes after it, the time complexity is O(n^2)

- Space complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a fixed amount of extra space for the count variable and the loop indices.

# Code
```
class Solution:
    def numIdenticalPairs(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i]==nums[j]:
                    count += 1
        return count
```
